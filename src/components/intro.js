I did a lot of SKULE stuff because I found it fun and I wanted something different from highschool, because highschool I was all in academic shit. I wanted to experience something different and new, so I jumped into SKULE as much as I could, but then I also neglected the academic equivalent of SKULE. There are so many design teams, and so many cool things where I can learn practical and technical skills which are just as fun as SKULE, but I ended up missing out on a lot of that because I wasn't able to time balance for fun and design teams. I definitely would want to explore a design team more, which would be my main thing. But I wouldn't want to give up what I have done. I wanna try to do everything, which is really difficult. - Hema Nookla ðŸ“·: Addy Bhatia"

Iâ€™ve lived in Dubai for 11 years and witnessed its metamorphosis into the city of dreams, which alone was just an experience. However, the main difference I noticed from Dubai and Toronto is the community. In Dubai, we live in a bubble, where just hearing a siren is an occasion in itself. Donâ€™t get me wrong, itâ€™s great that itâ€™s such a safe place to grow up in, but I just feel like this safe shell that just protects us from all the issues going on can sometimes result in a massive culture and exposure shock. People there can also be critical of your social class, which - if you havenâ€™t lived anywhere else before - can entrap you in this closed-minded mentality. Whereas in Toronto, no one cares who you are or where youâ€™re from. Iâ€™ve found everyone here very welcoming, where I can also get the chance to try out a whole bunch of new hobbies, and that lifestyle is encouraged. ðŸ“·: Addy Bhatia"

So I thought I want to help bring that. Lots of time in first year I kept hearing about this 'Skule' community that sounded really fun and great where everyone feels a part of it. But I felt like I was on the outside looking in, thinking wow look at this, this is so cool, I get to tell people I go to a place where this exists.

When I came into U of T I was really anxious and hard on myself, but everyone here was extremely supportive of me and helped me change how I see myself. This didnâ€™t all happen at once of course, it was a very slow and incremental process. Every day, month, and year, Iâ€™ve made progress for the better. And the support system that I have at UofT in my friends and everyone around me was vital. They didn't just help me feel better, but they pushed me to go for more and aim higher. Thatâ€™s why I wanted to be EngSoc President in my final year, because in a way, I felt like I had to give back and be that support for someone else. - Shivani Nathoo"

But through the craziness, the dropped pants, the heel click â€˜attacksâ€™, the broken calves and wrists, we started breaking that down. We canâ€™t put an exact time on when it happened.
